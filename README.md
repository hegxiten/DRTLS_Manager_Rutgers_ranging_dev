# DRTLS_Manager_Decawave_RU_Dev
 The Rutgers Rail development repo based on Decawave DRTLS Manager

# Prereqs (09.2022)
 The installation must be done through Android Studio 3.5 (use https://developer.android.com/studio/archive to download)
 Higher Android Studio version does not compile successfully due to gradle versioning issues. APK generation does not work due to the same reasons.

# NDK installation
 If the installation requires NDK, go https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads for NDK downloads and extract the corresponding directory from the ./toolchains/ directory into the project structure "Android NDK Location"
